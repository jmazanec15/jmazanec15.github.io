Make-a-Square

The goal of the game is to make a square on a board of playing cards before your opponent. The board is set up with 50 shuffled cards from a standard deck in a 5 by 10 rectangle. Each player is dealt 5 cards from a separate deck. Players can place a card on a space on the board that matches a card in their hand. Players alternate turns and the first one to form a 2 by 2 square wins.

Technology used: Javascpript, jQuery, CSS, Less, HTML

Had difficulty with scoring, tie game results, and computer moves towards the end of the game.

I would like to add more animation: visual of dealing cards, background music, onclick sounds. I also would like to figure out how to create pause bewteen player move and computer move. I would like to increase the complexity of the game. I also want to add more player options.
