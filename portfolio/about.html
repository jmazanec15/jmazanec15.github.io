    Hello! My name is Jack Mazanec and I am a freshman computer science major at the University of Notre Dame. Go Irish! I am from a suburb outside of Cleveland, Ohio called Bentleyville. Well, technically I was born in Budapest, Hungary, but I am not Hungarian at all. My dad just worked there for a couple of years and he and my mom just happened to have me. At the age of one, my journey abroad brought me to London, England until the age of two, when I moved to the Ohio. Although I would like to say that all of this traveling cultured me and gave me a unique perspective on life, I must say that I do not remember any of it. Of my two siblings, only one vaguely remembers going to preschool over there and apparently adopted a temporary British accent. Sadly, the only thing I took away from my travels is a solid fun fact at every icebreaker I attend.

  I have two sisters a couple years older than me. One is a communications major at Northwestern University and the other is a Psychology major here at Notre Dame. My dad works as the head of Environmental Health and Safety for Sherwin Williams, with a background in chemical engineering and law. My mother runs her own estate planning practice with a background in political science and law. Thankfully, against all odds, none of us children inherited the desire to go to law school.

  Growing up, I mainly focused on sports. I took pride in the fact that I played around seven of them: golf, baseball, hockey, football, tennis(kind of), lacrosse, and basketball. I quickly realized that it was crazy and narrowed it down to hockey and lacrosse. As a child, I put up with school, but never particularly enjoyed it. I liked math and science and that was about it. I dreaded writing and English classes, but managed to get through them. Outside of sports and school, I was also the president of my 8th grade class. I won on a platform promising large inflatables at school dances and guitar hero at lunch. Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic red tape, I was not able to deliver each promise I made.  However, I was able to deliver on one of my major ones: bringing Mike n' Ikes to the concession stands at school dances.

  After 8th grade, I decided to go to a large Jesuit all-boys high school in Cleveland called Saint Ignatius. Here, I played 4 years of hockey and lacrosse and even tied a state championship. Yes, I kid you not, tied.

I would like to go on the record saying that I was tired but did not feel like my or my teammates' safety was in danger after the 7th overtime. I did get on Sports Center however, so it was not all bad. I did do more stuff in high school than sports too. I participated in student government and was the Treasurer my senior year. The money I "earned" through that job may help me pay for this boot camp this summer. I also did a variety of service activities including one in which we would volunteer as Pallbearers for the funerals of those that had no one else that could do it for them. My high school instilled a strong appreciation of service in me that I would like to carry on throughout my life.

    Upon graduating high school, I decided to follow my father and sister's path and attend the University of Notre Dame. Heading in, thinking that because I liked Calculus and Physics, I would like Aerospace Engineering. However, a little after my first semester I decided that there is such thing as too much Calculus and Physics and that I wanted to pursue Computer Science instead. Along with keeping up with my academics, I joined a club called Design For America. In it, we use the design thinking process to come up with solutions to real world problems. Right now, we are working on a way to limit energy waste in dorm rooms.

    In the future, I am still not completely sure what I would like to do with Computer Science, but I think that I would like to run my own company some day. During the summers between my sophomore and junior year and junior and senior year, I would like to explore the industry through internships. This boot camp would really help give me the skills I would need to become competitive in these interview processes and give me a more specific idea of what I would like to do in the programming industry.
