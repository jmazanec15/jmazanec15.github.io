  <h2>
    Objective C and VBA
  </h2>
  <p class="body">
    Last summer, I worked with developers at the Cleveland Clinic to create apps to be used for research studies. One of my main projects was to help edit an existing app. The program originally showed a checkerboard with dots in random squares for a period of time on an iPad. Then, the dots would disappear and the subject would have to recall where each of them was by tapping the squares. This test was supposed to measure Multiple Sclerosis patients' spatial recall abilities. However, the doctors determined that the test was too easy. So, my job was to help change the dots to different symbols and then the subject would have to recall which symbol was in a particular square. I had no programming experience before this summer so to do this I used YouTube tutorials, developers at the lab, and previous code, to teach myself the basics of Objective C. From this project, I received a great look at how teams of developers work together on a project.

    During this summer, I also did a project using VBA. The lab needed a new randomization system to assign their subjects to a particular treatment group. The small caveat was that they did not want a difference in any of the groups to be larger than one. My job was to take their already existing program on Microsoft Access and change it to fit their new accommodations. This project was different because no one in lab including myself knew anything about VBA. So, I played around with the existing program and from that and Google, I learned the basics of VBA. From there, I used a trial and error method until I got the program to work.

  <h2>
    Labview
  </h2> 
  <p class="body">
    During the first semester of my freshman year, one of our projects for our general engineering class was to use Labview to program a robot to behave like a pet. For my group, we decided to make a dragon. The dragon was able to walk around without running into anything, sense whether there was anything in its mouth and, depending on that, make a crunch sound when it bit down, make a loud roar if anything was close to it, and thrash its tail. One other member in my group and myself were assigned to make the code for it. Labview is a very simple programming language that uses images and lines to determine what the robot will do. Although I will most likely never use it, it was a good introduction to the basics of programming and, for me, was pretty fun.

  <h2>
    Matlab
  </h2> 
  <p class="body">
    During the spring semester of my freshman year, the second general engineering course is focused on teaching the language Matlab. All semester, we have been learning all the different ways to use Matlab through little coding assignments and video tutorials. Along with this, we also have to complete a group project on a topic of our choice using Matlab. My group chose to make a MLB game prediction program. It essentially uses excel data sheets of a group of stats from last year and puts them into an algorithm to compute the win probability of a certain matchup. The user can pick which teams and pitchers are playing and the program will return a bar graph with each team's win probability and the results of the games last year.
